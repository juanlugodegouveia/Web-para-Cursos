# Web Design for Courses - Recreating Udemy page.

Web Design for courses, where the Udemy web page created with CSS Grid and Flexbox is recreated, using sass and gulp.

A simple and interactive design with which they could be cooked for future projects, the intention is to give an idea of how they could do it and save time.

The design is not fully responsive, as indicated above is to get an idea of the design and code, the media queries should be written at ease.
